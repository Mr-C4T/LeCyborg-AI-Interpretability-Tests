# LeCyborg-AI-Interpretability

This is a **fork of [physical-AI-interpretability](https://github.com/villekuosmanen/physical-AI-interpretability)**, adapted to provide **interpretability tools for the [LeCyborg project](https://github.com/Mr-C4T/LeCyborg)**.

While the original work focused on **visual attention mapping** + **proprioceptive features**, this fork's goal is to extend the attention visualization tools to support our **EMG sensor data** collected from the LeCyborg wearable myo sensor. (🚧 Work in progress 🚧)
